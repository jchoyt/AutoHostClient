What is it?
<ul><li> The Stars! AutoHost Client is an application to make interacting with the AutoHost website
 and Stars!
 a little easier.  Easier?  Than AutoHost? Yup.  See the feature list below.</li></ul>
Features:
<br>
<ul><li>downloads turns from AutoHost
<li>creates .FXX and .PXX files for all files downloaded
<li>creates backups of every m-file downloaded
<li>checks with AH every 10 minutes and shows status (current
 new m file available
 or needs to be uploaded)
<li>uploads turns for you with one click (mulitple x-files per game!)
<li>launches Stars! turns with one mouse click
    </ul>
    Instructions:
<br>
<ul>
<li>Install Java 1.4 JRE (not the SDK) (you can get this from Sun <a href=http://java.sun.com/j2se/downloads.html>here</a>).
<li>Put the jar file in the same directory as your stars.exe file.
<li>On Windows
 double click on the jar file.
<li>Make sure your path to stars.exe is correct.
<li>Fill in the game paramenters
<li>You should be ready.
<li>If you are behind a proxy
 there is no automatic installation step for that. Just follow the instructions above
 then go to the options pane and add your proxy host and port.
</ul>
To do:
<ul><li>Check status of x-file more often
<li>Check to see if x-file is just a save or a save and submit.  Currently
 AHC assumes all x-files are submits.
<li>Variable time to check AH
<li>Implement alternate/enhanced checking.
</ul>
Thanks to Michael Auwers, Jeff McBride, and especially Ron Miller.  Without their help, this would not have been possible.
