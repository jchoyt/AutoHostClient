		<h1>Stars! Autohost Client Battle Simulator</h1>
		<p>
			So you want to use the Battle Simulator do you ?
		</p>
		<p>
			First, a quick disclaimer:-
			<br/>
			The Stars! battle engine is a complex system with several random elements, and it's behaviour
			is not fully understood in several areas.  It is therefore impossible to create a simulator that
			will 100% accurately reproduce the results of the battle engine.
			<br/>
			The AHC battle simulator is a &quot;best efforts&quot; implementation that manages to get quite close
			to real battle engine results in a lot of cases.  However, there are no guarantees and you use
			it entirely at your own risk.  If you lose your main warfleet because the battle didn't go the
			way the simulator said it would, don't blame us.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now that we've got that out of the way, here's how to use it.
		</p>
		<p>
			Everything in the AutoHost Client starts with a game, and the battle simulator is no exception. You
			can't use the simulator unless you have a game defined.
		</p>
		<p>
			You also need to make sure that you have the correct plugins loaded.  You will need base.jar, 
			battlesim.jar and objedit.jar at the very least. Make sure these are in your plugins directory.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you have the plugins loaded then there will be a &quot;Data Editor&quot; button for each game.  Click this
			button for the game you are working with to diplay the data editor.
		</p>
		<p>
			The data editor has &quot;tabs&quot; across the top for planets, fleets, etc.  One of the tabs is
			for &quot;Designs&quot; - click this.  You can now store details of the ship designs that you want to work
			with.  These designs are stored in a file in your game directory, so you should only have to
			enter the details of each design once, no matter how many times you use it in the battle engine.
		</p>
		<p>
			For each design, enter the basic details of shields, armour, initiative, etc.  Once you have done
			that, add details of the different weapons slots. For each weapons slot, specifiy the type of 
			weapon and how many ther are.  Note that you should specify the weapons on a slot-by-slot basis; 
			for example, a destroyer with 2 colloidal phasers should have two entries, each with one
			colloidal phase rather than one entry with 2 phasers.  If you don't follow this rule you will
			get the wrong results.
		</p>
		<p>
			Once you have entered the ship designs you are after (and saved them), click the &quot;Battle 
			Sim&quot; button.
		</p>
		<p>
			Pick the ship designs you want, and specify how many of each there are.  Then click the &quot;Run
			Simulation&quot; button.
		</p>
		<p>
			The battle simulator will now run, and the results will be displayed in the report.
