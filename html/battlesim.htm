		<h1>The Stars! Battle Simulator</h1>
		
		<p>
			First, a quick disclaimer:-
			<br>
			The Stars! battle engine is a complex system with several random elements, and it's behaviour
			is not fully understood in several areas.  It is therefore impossible to create a simulator that
			will 100% accurately reproduce the results of the battle engine.
			<br>
			The AHC battle simulator is a &quot;best efforts&quot; implementation that manages to get quite close
			to real battle engine results in a lot of cases.  However, there are no guarantees and you use
			it entirely at your own risk.  If you lose your main warfleet because the battle didn't go the
			way the simulator said it would, don't blame us.
		</p>

		<h2>Installation</h2>		
		<p>
			The Battle Simulator is written in Java which means that it will require a Java Runtime Environment (JRE).
			You can download a free JRE from the Java web site at <a href="http://www.java.com/">www.java.com</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Next, download the BattleSimulator itself.  This is the file called &quot;BattleSim.jar&quot;. To start
			the program you should be able to just double click on the jar file.  To start the program from the
			command line, run &quot;java -jar battlesim.jar&quot;.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Using the Battle Simulator</h2>
		<p>
			The following assumes you are familiar with Stars! terminology such as &quot;token&quot; and 
			&quot;round&quot;.
		</p>
		<h3>Basic setup</h3>
		<p>
			Select &quot;File / New&quot; from the main menu to start a new simulation.  The next thing you need
			to do is add some tokens to the battle.  A token (also known as a &quot;stack&quot;)
			is a number of ships, each with the same design, and
			from the same fleet. Each token also has a &quot;side&quot; - tokens on different sides will attack
			each other.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can add tokens using the &quot;Add&quot; button below the tokens list.  This adds a new, empty,
			token to the list and then opens the ship design editor window.  Here you can enter the details of
			the ship design.  It is best to copy the values directly from the ship design screen (F4) in the 
			game.
		</p>
		<p>
			Once you have specified the base values (armour, shields, speed, etc.) for the design you can add
			weapons to it using the &quot;Add Weapon&quot; button.  It is important to note that you are actually
			describing the design &quot;slots&quot; that contain weapons - there should be one entry in the weapon
			slots table for each slot in the ship design that contains weapons.  For each weapon slot you specify
			the type of weapon and how many there are.
		</p>
		<p>
			For example, if you have a destroyer design with two colloidal phasers in the weapon slots and a
			beta torpedo in the general purpose slot, you would have three rows in the weapon slots table. 
		</p>
		<p>
			After you have specified the ship design, close the design editor and then enter the number of
			ships in the token, as well as which side the token is on (just a number).  You will need at least
			two stacks on different sides, with at least one of them having weapons, for a battle to take 
			place.
		</p>
		<p>
			Once you have specified the tokens that will participate in the battle it is a good idea to save
			the simulation configuration.  You do this with the &quot;File / Save&quot; menu item.
		</p>
		<p>
			You should now be ready to run the simulation.  To do this, click the &quot;Run&quot; button or
			press the F5 key.
		</p>
		<p>
			The results of the battle will now be diplayed in the main part of the window.  Assuming the
			&quot;Show designs&quot; check box is checked the display will start with an outline of the
			tokens that participate in the battle.
		</p>
		<p>
			There will also be a line that says that the random number generator has been initialised with
			a &quot;seed&quot; value.  You can enter a seed value in the control panel on the left before
			running the simulation.  If the value of 0 is used then the battle will be different every time.
			If a non-zero value is used then the same starting setup will always produce the same results,
			for whatever seed value is specified.  
		</p>
		<p>
			After this will come the results of the battle.  There will be a line of output for each time
			that a token moves or fires it's weapons.
		</p>
		<p>
			At the end of the display will be the final status of each token, showing how many ships 
			survived (if any) and how much damage they took.
